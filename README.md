# Telecom-Industry-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Data cleaning &amp; processing in Excel and Exploratory data analysis of telecom churn visualized in a Power BI dashboard. The project investigates customer churn based on various factors, including salary segment, geography, gender, and customer tenure.
This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn using business intelligence techniques. The aim is to evaluate churn trends across different demographics, salary segments, telecom partners, and service usage behaviors, thereby helping management make data-driven decisions.
This project leverages Excel and Power BI to analyze customer churn from a telecom dataset. Excel was used for initial data cleaning and processing, while Power BI was used for visualization and dashboard creation.

Key findings from the analysis include:
•	Out of 244K customers, 49K churned, giving a 20% churn rate.
•	Mid-aged (43.9%) and adult (40.1%) groups account for the highest churn.
•	High-income and very high-income customers show greater churn tendency.
•	Airtel and Reliance Jio customers recorded higher churn rates compared to Vodafone and BSNL.
•	Male customers (29K) churned more than female customers (20K).
•	Customers with larger families had slightly higher churn compared to solos.

Steps Involved in Building the Project
1.	Data Collection & Preprocessing
2.	Data Modeling in Power BI
3.	Dashboard Design
4.	Insights Generation


Such findings enable companies to:
•	Implement targeted retention strategies for high-risk groups.
•	Offer personalized plans and discounts to valuable customers.
•	Continuously monitor churn patterns with Power BI dashboards.
By combining Excel for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, this project demonstrates an effective approach to understanding and mitigating customer churn.
